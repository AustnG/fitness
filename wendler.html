            In 5/3/1, you're expected to train three or four days a week. Each workout is centered around one core lift: Parallel Squat -Bench Press Deadlift -Shoulder Press Each training cycle lasts four weeks, with these set-rep goals for each major lift: Week
            1 3 x 5 Week 2 3 x 3 Week 3 3 x 5, 3, 1 Week 4 Deload Then you start the next cycle, using heavier weights on the core lifts. And that's where a seemingly simple system starts getting a little more complicated. You aren't just picking a weight
            to lift five times or three times or one time per set. You're using a specific percentage of your one-rep max. And not your full 1RM. The calculations are based on 90% of it (ex. So if your 1RM in the bench press is 315 pounds, you use 285
            (90%) as the base number for your training-weight calculations). Here's how it works: Untitled When you see 5+, 3+, or 1+, that means you do the max reps you can manage with that weight, with the goal of setting a rep record in each workout.
            After you finish the first cycle, you add 5 lbs to your 1RM calculations for the two upper-body lifts and 10 lbs to your 1RM for the squat and deadlift. DO NOT run yourself into the ground with conditioning; follow the "5/3/1 50-60% Rule"
            when conditioning. Assistance Work Each day perform ONE or TWO exercise from each category listed below. Perform 50-100 total reps on whatever rep-scheme you want. The three categories to choose from are: push, pull, and single leg/core: Push:
            dips, push-ups, DB bench/incline/press, triceps extensions/pushdowns Pull: chin-ups/pull-ups, inverted rows, rows (DB/machine/BB), face pulls, band pull-aparts, lat pulldown, curls Single Leg/Core: any abdominal work, back raises, reverse
            hyperextensions, lunges, step-ups, Bulgarian one-leg squats, KB snatches, swings Good Additions: 10-15 box jumps or med ball throws PRIOR to lifting. Running or conditioning should be done.
